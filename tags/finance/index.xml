      <title>Insurance and the Kelly criterion</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article describes how to use the Kelly criterion to make rational
choices when confronted with a risky financial decision, and suggests
a way to estimate the most you should be willing to pay for any
particular sort of insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kelly criterion (which at its core is the idea that the logarithm
of your wealth is a better measure of money&#39;s value to you than its absolute
value) is well understood by the informed gambling community, and
should be more widely known.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you decide to apply the knowledge in this post, also consult with a financial
professional (which as we&#39;ll see later doesn&#39;t include most finance or economics
students, and most young financial professionals), and read the disclaimer at the end.
